# IPL-visualization
A tableau visualization project that creates 3 dashboards to showcase different facets of the lucrative tournament upto 2017
The Indian Premier League, or IPL, is a T20 cricket league, which was founded in 2008 and is held every year. It sees participation from both national and international players, and eight teams representing eight Indian cities compete with each other in a double round-robin format in the league stages, which are followed by playoffs. Over the years, IPL has become one of the mostï¿½watched and most attended live sporting events all over the world.

For this project I have built 3 interactive Tableau dashboards of IPL statistics over the years (upto 2017) since its inception in order to create an infographic.
